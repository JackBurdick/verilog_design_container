# Verilog Design
This project contains files of verilog implementations for various components.

## Note:
- [ModelSim PE Student Edition](https://www.mentor.com/company/higher_ed/modelsim-student-edition) was used as the design and testing environment
- `./clock/` directory contains components for creating a digital alarm clock in verilog
- a mix of gate-level, dataflow, and behavioral modeling is used
- `./state_machines/` have their own `README.md` files

## TODO:
- Organize and document files
- Complete SM for digital alarm clock
